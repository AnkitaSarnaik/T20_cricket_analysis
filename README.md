# T20_cricket_analysis

Created a Power BI report to identify the top 11 for the T20 cricket team by analyzing the data, also cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various players' performance.

Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories ( openers, middle/order/anchors, finishers, all-rounder) and ultimately choose the top players to play in the match.
